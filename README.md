# Intermittent Error Sending Response with Special Characters in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where an Express.js server intermittently throws an error when sending a response containing certain special characters.  The error is difficult to reproduce consistently, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

The server generally functions correctly, but under certain circumstances (possibly related to load or timing), sending a response with special characters (e.g., accented characters, emojis) results in an uncaught error.  Standard error handling middleware doesn't consistently capture this error.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send requests to the server's `/` endpoint.  Observe that after multiple requests, a server error might occur.

## Solution

The solution involves using a robust JSON.stringify with error handling to manage potential issues with special characters and edge cases that might result in unexpected errors during the process of sending responses.

## Solution Implementation

The solution is in `bugSolution.js` file. This version uses JSON.stringify and error handling to consistently handle the special characters in responses, resolving the intermittent error that occured previously.
